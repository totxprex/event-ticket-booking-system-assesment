# Event Ticket Booking System

This is a Node.js application that implements an event ticket booking system. It exposes a RESTful API that allows initializing events, booking tickets (with a waiting list if sold out), canceling bookings (with automatic assignment from the waiting list), and viewing event status. Order details are saved in a SQLite database.

## Features

- **Initialize Event:** Create a new event with a specified number of tickets.
- **Book Ticket:** Book a ticket for a user. If the event is sold out, the user is added to the waiting list.
- **Cancel Booking:** Cancel a userâ€™s booking. If a waiting list exists, automatically assign the ticket to the next waiting user.
- **Event Status:** Retrieve available tickets and waiting list count.
- **Concurrency Handling:** Uses async locks to ensure thread-safety.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Includes unit and integration tests with over 80% coverage.
- **Error Handling:** Provides meaningful error messages.
